This is the code for my personal site. If you wish to use the HTML and CSS for your own personal use, you are very welcome. The design of my personal site is based off Bootstrap. 

There is a bit of custom CSS in there though. You can check out my personal site [here](<http://www.aligajani.com>). I wrote nice tutorial on the use of media queries implemented on my personal site, so head to this link [here](<http://www.mrgeek.me/technology/tutorials/web-design/how-to-make-text-responsive-in-bootstrap/>.)
